### 👋 Hi, I'm Faranjit
I build tools that make AI systems observable and reliable.

#### 🚀 AccordKit
**[AccordKit](https://accordkit.dev)** is an open-source observability toolkit for AI apps.  
It provides SDKs for tracing ([@accordkit/tracer](https://npmjs.com/package/@accordkit/tracer)), provider adapters, and a real-time viewer.

Tech: TypeScript • React • Vite • Cloudflare • OpenTelemetry-inspired architecture.
